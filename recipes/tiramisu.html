        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A creamy, cake-like dessert of espresso-soaked ladyfingers surrounded by lightly 
            sweetened whipped cream and a rich mascarpone. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>Mascarpone</li>
            <li>Very Strong Coffee</li>
            <li>Rum or Cognac</li>
            <li>Unsweetened Cocoa Powder</li>
            <li>Ladyfingers</li>
            <li>Bittersweet Chocolate (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams sugar 
                until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the 
                beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Transfer mixture to a large bowl, 
                wiping out the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates 
                soft-medium peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, 
                spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the 
                sweetened egg yolks until combined.</li>
            <li>Combine coffee and rum/cognac in a shallow bowl and set aside</li>
            <li>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch dish, 
                or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- 
                they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- 
                and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish. Repeat, 
                using half the ladyfingers, until you have got an even layer, breaking the 
                ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious gaps (a little space 
                in between is O.K.). Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers 
                in one even layer. Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers 
                and mascarpone mixture.</li>
            <li>Dust top layer with remaining tablesppoon of cocoa powder. Top with shaved or
                finely grated chocolate, if desired.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in refrigerator for at least 4 hours before serving.</li>
        </ol>
